    <h2>Why I Chose Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>
     I’ve always preferred using my head over my hands. In university, I explored web development but realized what truly excited me was understanding the “why” behind results. This curiosity led me through business analysis training and hands-on problem-solving in my own business, uncovering patterns and insights that drove meaningful impact. That’s when I knew data analysis was my calling. To read the full story, check out one of my posts on LinkedIn

  <!-- What Drives Me -->
  <section id="drives-me">
    <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m fueled by curiosity and the joy of bringing ideas to life—whether solving complex problems at work 
      or refining personal projects. I love turning concepts into reality and believe that meaningful success 
      often comes over the long term. I strive to give my best in everything I commit to while balancing 
      family, personal growth, and well-being.

  <!-- Beyond Work -->

    <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I’m usually cycling, spending time with my dogs, or enjoying moments with family. I’m also a Pastor, I leading God’s people and teaching his Word. I love exploring personal projects, learning new skills, and sharing knowledge through tutorials, live sessions, and bootcamps—guiding others to grow, solve problems, and make data meaningful in real-world decisions.
